# PokeReact

## [Live page here](https://www.example.com)

	*Or you can clone this project and do a classic 'npm i' and 'npm start'*

### Custom packages that I decided to use:

- Material-UI
- ReduxJs Toolkit
- Axios
- Gh-pages
- React-hook-form
- Redux
- Husky
- Prettier

### Decisions that I've made about the project

1 - I used redux to store custom pokemons and to have a clean way to add pokemons and (in the future) remove them.

2 - I choose [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) just for have a many components out to the box ready for work, for example the pokemons table and detail.

3 - I structured the project into pages, components (Did not have time for make an **'atoms'** folder for inputs i.e).

4 - I tried to follow a [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) classname convention and the use of nested classes.

5 - I made a quick deploy to [gh-pages](https://github.com/Dkreick/PokeReact/actions) so even people who don't code can see the project.

6 - For clean code purposes, I enforced the use of hooks with [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) commit so everyone who pushes changes will have his code formatted.
